## Development stages (List of todos)
* Basic Nodejs server and front 
** Set up a basic Nodejs server using Express
** Add a minimalist HTML5 layout with an upload form or area, maybe use [awmd stats layout](https://github.com/ch3nkula/awmd-stats)
* Implement file upload in form and validation logic
** Add drag and drop feature for 1 or more images
** Extract image ID from its title
** Preliminary validation on drag and drop: check title and file format.
** Second validation: make sure image does not already exist on Commons
** Third licence check: if image has CC BY-SA credit within the file SVG file, remove it as the info added to the icon during upload already includes credit: name, author, link, etc. 
* Fetch details for each image, based on its ID, by querying thenounproject.com (eg:https://thenounproject.com/icon/145926)
* Implement image upload to Commons
** Upload to Commons
** Notify user regarding the upload status
** Add necessary description to image, similarly to [what wikibot-nodejs used to do](https://github.com/samuelguebo/wikibot-nodejs/blob/47a425102dfbdb0f446c7ca1d8f566109a2d479c/upload-from-thenoun.js#L158-L179).
** Notify user regarding the description update process
** Notify user regarding the final upload url on Commons
* Allow user to start another process
* Unit tests with [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) or [Jazmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine)
